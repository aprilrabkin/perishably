Perishab.li
===========

A Rails application sending real-time alerts of food and cosmetic expiration dates. 

**Repository moved to xxSandiLLyxx/perishably2

See the app in action at perishably.herokuapp.com

This is a class project from Flatiron School in the summer of 2014. 

My contributions:
-scraped generic expiration dates from hundreds of pages on eatbydate.com.
-used jQuery-UI and AJAX to create clean, dynamic forms.
-helped set up an email and Twilio (text message) notification system.
-deployed the app on Heroku, and what that involved: 
    -transfered the database from SQLite to Postgres 
    -fixed the asset pipeline for CSS and Javascript in production mode.
